# Wifi Jammer with ESP2866


A WiFi jammer is a device that disrupts or blocks wireless signals on the WiFi frequency bands, effectively causing interference and preventing nearby devices from connecting to a WiFi network. These jammers operate by emitting radio frequency signals on the same frequencies used by WiFi networks, thereby overpowering or disrupting the signals from legitimate WiFi devices.

## Jammer X Deauther

A Wi-Fi deauther is a device that sends deauthentication packets to disconnect specific devices from a Wi-Fi network, often used for network security testing or troubleshooting. It targets individual devices and is generally considered less intrusive and more legally permissible compared to a Wi-Fi jammer.

A Wi-Fi jammer, on the other hand, disrupts entire Wi-Fi signals within its range by flooding the Wi-Fi spectrum with interference. It affects all devices within its vicinity and is typically illegal due to its indiscriminate disruption of Wi-Fi networks.
