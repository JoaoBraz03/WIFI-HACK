# WIFI-HACK
In this project I gonna teach you how to use the NODE MCU and turn it into a wifi deuther.

# What is a wifi deauther?

 The attack involves sending forged deauthentication frames to a wireless access point or client device, causing the device to disconnect from the network.

 # Deauther X Jammer

While both jammers and deauth attacks can disrupt wireless communication, they are used for different purposes and have different legal implications. Jammers are generally illegal and used to block various wireless signals, while deauth attacks are a specific technique used to test and secure Wi-Fi networks, often in ethical hacking scenarios. It's important to note that using either of these tools or techniques without proper authorization can be illegal and unethical.

# Steps

1.Connect the ESP8266.

2.Install the NODEMCU Flash Master.

3.Open the NODEMCU Flash Master and click on the engine and sellect the binary code.

4.It will creat a wifi access point called "pwned" and the password is "deauhter".

5.Go to your broser and search for IP of the access point.

6.Select the WIFI, go to 'ATTACK' and chose 'Deauth'.
